<Intro>

`useReducer` is a React Hook that enables you add a [reducer](/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer) to your component.

```js
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialArg, init?)
```

</Intro>

## Reference {/*reference*/}

### `useReducer(reducer, initialArg, init?)` {/*usereducer*/}

Call `useReducer` at the top level of your component to manage its state with a [reducer.](/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer)

```js
import { useReducer } from 'react';

function reducer(state, action) {
  // ...
}

function MyComponent() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { age: 42 });
  // ...
```

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters {/*parameters*/}

* `reducer`: The reducer function that specifies how the state gets updated. It must be pure, should take the state and action as arguments, and should return the next state. State and action can be of any types. 
* `initialArg`: The value from which the initial state is calculated. It can be a value of any type. How the initial state is calculated from it depends on the next `init` argument.
* **optional** `init`: The initializer function that should return the initial state. If it's not specified, the initial state is set to `initialArg`. Otherwise, the initial state is set to the result of calling `init(initialArg)`.

#### Returns {/*returns*/}

`useReducer` returns an array with exactly two values:

1. The current state. During the first render, it's set to `init(initialArg)` or `initialArg` (if there's no `init`).
2. The [`dispatch` function](#dispatch) that enables you to update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render.

#### Caveats {/*caveats*/}

* `useReducer` is a Hook, so you can only call it **at the top level of your component** or your own Hooks. You can't call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.
* In Strict Mode, React will **call your reducer and initializer twice** in order to [help you find accidental impurities.](#my-reducer-or-initializer-function-runs-twice) This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. If your reducer and initializer are pure (as they should be), this should not affect your logic. The result from one of the calls is ignored.

---

### `dispatch` function {/*dispatch*/}

The `dispatch` function returned by `useReducer` enables you to update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render. You need to pass the action as the only argument to the `dispatch` function:

```js
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { age: 42 });

function handleClick() {
  dispatch({ type: 'incremented_age' });
  // ...
```

React will set the next state to the result of calling the `reducer` function you've provided with the current `state` and the action you've passed to `dispatch`.

#### Parameters {/*dispatch-parameters*/}

* `action`: The action performed by the user. It can be a value of any type. By convention, an action is usually an object with a `type` property identifying it and, optionally, other properties with additional information.

#### Returns {/*dispatch-returns*/}

`dispatch` functions do not have a return value.

#### Caveats {/*setstate-caveats*/}

* The `dispatch` function **only updates the state variable for the *next* render**. If you read the state variable after calling the `dispatch` function, [you will still get the old value](#ive-dispatched-an-action-but-logging-gives-me-the-old-state-value) that was on the screen before your call.

* If the new value you provide is identical to the current `state`, as determined by an [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison, React will **skip re-rendering the component and its children.** This is an optimization. React may still need to call your component before ignoring the result, but it shouldn't affect your code.

* React [batches state updates.](/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates) It updates the screen **after all the event handlers have run** and have called their `set` functions. This prevents multiple re-renders during a single event. In the rare case that you need to force React to update the screen earlier, for example to access the DOM, you can use [`flushSync`.](/reference/react-dom/flushSync)

## Usage {/*usage*/}

### Adding a reducer to a component {/*adding-a-reducer-to-a-component*/}

Call `useReducer` at the top level of your component to manage state with a [reducer.](/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer)

```js [[1, 8, "state"], [2, 8, "dispatch"], [4, 8, "reducer"], [3, 8, "{ age: 42 }"]]
import { useReducer } from 'react';

function reducer(state, action) {
  // ...
}

function MyComponent() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { age: 42 });
  // ...
```

`useReducer` returns an array with exactly two items:

1. The <CodeStep step={1}>current state</CodeStep> of this state variable, initially set to the <CodeStep step={3}>initial state</CodeStep> you provided.
2. The <CodeStep step={2}>`dispatch` function</CodeStep> that enables you change it in response to interaction.

To update what's on the screen, call <CodeStep step={2}>`dispatch`</CodeStep> with an object representing what the user did, called an *action*:

```js [[2, 2, "dispatch"]]
function handleClick() {
  dispatch({ type: 'incremented_age' });
}
```

React will pass the current state and the action to your <CodeStep step={4}>reducer function</CodeStep>. Your reducer will calculate and return the next state. React will store that next state, render your component with it, and update the UI.

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useReducer } from 'react';

function reducer(state, action) {
  if (action.type === 'incremented_age') {
    return {
      age: state.age + 1
    };
  }
  throw Error('Unknown action.');
}

export default function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { age: 42 });

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => {
        dispatch({ type: 'incremented_age' })
      }}>
        Increment age
      </button>
      <p>Hello! You are {state.age}.</p>
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
button { display: block; margin-top: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

`useReducer` is very similar to [`useState`](/reference/react/useState), but it enables you move the state update logic from event handlers into a single function outside of your component. Read more about [choosing between `useState` and `useReducer`.](/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer#comparing-usestate-and-usereducer)

### Writing the reducer function {/*writing-the-reducer-function*/}

A reducer function is declared like this:

```js
function reducer(state, action) {
  // ...
}
```

Then you need to fill in the code that will calculate and return the next state. By convention, it is common to write it as a [`switch` statement.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch) For each `case` in the `switch`, calculate and return some next state.

```js {4-7,10-13}
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'incremented_age': {
      return {
        name: state.name,
        age: state.age + 1
      };
    }
    case 'changed_name': {
      return {
        name: action.nextName,
        age: state.age
      };
    }
  }
  throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);
}
```

Actions can have any shape. By convention, it's common to pass objects with a `type` property identifying the action. It should include the minimal necessary information that the reducer needs to compute the next state.

```js {5,9-12}
function Form() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { name: 'Taylor', age: 42 });
  
  function handleButtonClick() {
    dispatch({ type: 'incremented_age' });
  }

  function handleInputChange(e) {
    dispatch({
      type: 'changed_name',
      nextName: e.target.value
    });
  }
  // ...
```

The action type names are local to your component. [Each action describes a single interaction, even if that leads to multiple changes in data.](/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer#writing-reducers-well) The shape of the state is arbitrary, but usually it'll be an object or an array.

Read [extracting state logic into a reducer](/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer) to learn more.

<Pitfall>

State is read-only. Don't modify any objects or arrays in state:

```js {4,5}
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'incremented_age': {
      // ðŸš© Don't mutate an object in state like this:
      state.age = state.age + 1;
      return state;
    }
```

Instead, always return new objects from your reducer:

```js {4-8}
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'incremented_age': {
      // âœ… Instead, return a new object
      return {
        ...state,
        age: state.age + 1
      };
    }
```

#### Form (object) {/*form-object*/}

In this example, the reducer manages a state object with two fields: `name` and `age`.

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useReducer } from 'react';

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'incremented_age': {
      return {
        name: state.name,
        age: state.age + 1
      };
    }
    case 'changed_name': {
      return {
        name: action.nextName,
        age: state.age
      };
    }
  }
  throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);
}

const initialState = { name: 'Taylor', age: 42 };

export default function Form() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  function handleButtonClick() {
    dispatch({ type: 'incremented_age' });
  }

  function handleInputChange(e) {
    dispatch({
      type: 'changed_name',
      nextName: e.target.value
    }); 
  }

  return (
    <>
      <input
        value={state.name}
        onChange={handleInputChange}
      />
      <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>
        Increment age
      </button>
      <p>Hello, {state.name}. You are {state.age}.</p>
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
button { display: block; margin-top: 10px; }
```

#### Todo list (array) {/*todo-list-array*/}

In this example, the reducer manages an array of tasks. The array needs to be updated [without mutation.](/learn/updating-arrays-in-state)

```js App.js
import { useReducer } from 'react';

        text: action.text,
        done: false
      }];
    }
    case 'changed': {
      return tasks.map(t => {

#### Writing concise update logic with Immer {/*writing-concise-update-logic-with-immer*/}

If updating arrays and objects without mutation feels tedious, you can use a library like [Immer](https://github.com/immerjs/use-immer#useimmerreducer) to reduce repetitive code. Immer enables you write concise code as if you were mutating objects, but under the hood it performs immutable updates:

<Sandpack>

```js App.js
import { useImmerReducer } from 'use-immer';
import AddTask from './AddTask.js';
import TaskList from './TaskList.js';

function tasksReducer(draft, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'added': {
      draft.push({
        id: action.id,
        text: action.text,
        done: false
      });
      break;
    }
    case 'changed': {
      const index = draft.findIndex(t =>
        t.id === action.task.id
      );
      draft[index] = action.task;
      break;
    }
    case 'deleted': {
      return draft.filter(t => t.id !== action.id);
    }
    default: {
      throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);
    }
  }
}

export default function TaskApp() {
  const [tasks, dispatch] = useImmerReducer(

### Avoiding recreating the initial state {/*avoiding-recreating-the-initial-state*/}

React saves the initial state once and ignores it on the next renders.

```js
function createInitialState(username) {
  // ...
}

function TodoList({ username }) {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, createInitialState(username));
  // ...
```

Although the result of `createInitialState(username)` is only used for the initial render, you're still calling this function on every render. This can be wasteful if it's creating large arrays or performing expensive calculations.

To solve this, you may **pass it as an _initializer_ function** to `useReducer` as the third argument instead:

```js {6}
function createInitialState(username) {
  // ...
}

function TodoList({ username }) {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, username, createInitialState);
  // ...
```

Notice that youâ€™re passing `createInitialState`, which is the *function itself*, and not `createInitialState()`, which is the result of calling it. This way, the initial state does not get re-created after initialization.

In the above example, `createInitialState` takes a `username` argument. If your initializer doesn't need any information to compute the initial state, you may pass `null` as the second argument to `useReducer`.

<Recipes titleText="The difference between passing an initializer and passing the initial state directly" titleId="examples-initializer">

#### Passing the initializer function {/*passing-the-initializer-function*/}

This example passes the initializer function, so the `createInitialState` function only runs during initialization. It does not run when component re-renders, such as when you type into the input.

#### Passing the initial state directly {/*passing-the-initial-state-directly*/}

This example **does not** pass the initializer function, so the `createInitialState` function runs on every render, such as when you type into the input. There is no observable difference in behavior, but this code is less efficient.

<Sandpack>

```js App.js hidden
import TodoList from './TodoList.js';

export default function App() {
  return <TodoList username="Taylor" />;
}
```

```js TodoList.js active
import { useReducer } from 'react';

function createInitialState(username) {
  const initialTodos = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
    initialTodos.push({
      id: i,
      text: username + "'s task #" + (i + 1)
    });
  }
  return {
    draft: '',
    todos: initialTodos,
  };
}

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'changed_draft': {
      return {
        draft: action.nextDraft,
        todos: state.todos,
      };
    };
    case 'added_todo': {
      return {
        draft: '',
        todos: [{
          id: state.todos.length,
          text: state.draft
        }, ...state.todos]
      }
    }
  }
  throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);
}

export default function TodoList({ username }) {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(
    reducer,
    createInitialState(username)
  );
  return (
    <>
      <input
        value={state.draft}
        onChange={e => {
          dispatch({
            type: 'changed_draft',
            nextDraft: e.target.value
          })
        }}
      />
      <button onClick={() => {
        dispatch({ type: 'added_todo' });
      }}>Add</button>
      <ul>
        {state.todos.map(item => (
          <li key={item.id}>
            {item.text}
          </li>

## Troubleshooting {/*troubleshooting*/}

### I've dispatched an action, but logging gives me the old state value {/*ive-dispatched-an-action-but-logging-gives-me-the-old-state-value*/}

Calling the `dispatch` function **does not change state in the running code**:

```js {4,5,8}
function handleClick() {
  console.log(state.age);  // 42

  dispatch({ type: 'incremented_age' }); // Request a re-render with 43
  console.log(state.age);  // Still 42!

  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(state.age); // Also 42!
  }, 5000);
}
```

This is because [states behaves like a snapshot.](/learn/state-as-a-snapshot) Updating state requests another render with the new state value, but does not affect the `state` JavaScript variable in your already-running event handler.

If you need to guess the next state value, you can calculate it manually by calling the reducer yourself:

```js
const action = { type: 'incremented_age' };
dispatch(action);

const nextState = reducer(state, action);
console.log(state);     // { age: 42 }
console.log(nextState); // { age: 43 }
```

---

### I've dispatched an action, but the screen doesn't update {/*ive-dispatched-an-action-but-the-screen-doesnt-update*/}

React will **ignore your update if the next state is equal to the previous state,** as determined by an [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison. This usually happens when you change an object or an array in state directly:

```js {4-5,9-10}
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'incremented_age': {
      // ðŸš© Wrong: mutating existing object
      state.age++;
      return state;
    }
    case 'changed_name': {
      // ðŸš© Wrong: mutating existing object
      state.name = action.nextName;
      return state;
    }
    // ...
  }
}
```

You mutated an existing `state` object and returned it, so React ignored the update. To fix this, you need to ensure that you're always [updating objects in state](/learn/updating-objects-in-state) and [updating arrays in state](/learn/updating-arrays-in-state) instead of mutating them:

```js {4-8,11-15}
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'incremented_age': {
      // âœ… Correct: creating a new object
      return {
        ...state,
        age: state.age + 1
      };
    }
    case 'changed_name': {
      // âœ… Correct: creating a new object
      return {
        ...state,
        name: action.nextName
      };
    }
    // ...
  }
}
```

---

### A part of my reducer state becomes undefined after dispatching {/*a-part-of-my-reducer-state-becomes-undefined-after-dispatching*/}

Make sure that every `case` branch **copies all of the existing fields** when returning the new state:

```js {5}
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'incremented_age': {
      return {
        ...state, // Don't forget this!
        age: state.age + 1
      };
    }
    // ...
```

Without `...state` above, the returned next state would only contain the `age` field and nothing else.

---

### My entire reducer state becomes undefined after dispatching {/*my-entire-reducer-state-becomes-undefined-after-dispatching*/}

If your state unexpectedly becomes `undefined`, you're likely forgetting to `return` state in one of the cases, or your action type doesn't match any of the `case` statements. To find why, throw an error outside the `switch`:

```js {10}
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'incremented_age': {
      // ...
    }
    case 'edited_name': {
      // ...
    }
  }
  throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);
}
```

You can also use a static type checker like TypeScript to catch such mistakes.

---

### I'm getting an error: "Too many re-renders" {/*im-getting-an-error-too-many-re-renders*/}

You might get an error that says: `Too many re-renders. React limits the number of renders to prevent an infinite loop.` Typically, this means that you're unconditionally dispatching an action *during render*, so your component enters a loop: render, dispatch (which causes a render), render, dispatch (which causes a render), and so on. Very often, this is caused by a mistake in specifying an event handler:

```js {1-2}
// ðŸš© Wrong: calls the handler during render
return <button onClick={handleClick()}>Click me</button>

// âœ… Correct: passes down the event handler
return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>

// âœ… Correct: passes down an inline function
return <button onClick={(e) => handleClick(e)}>Click me</button>
```

If you can't find the cause of this error, click on the arrow next to the error in the console and look through the JavaScript stack to find the specific `dispatch` function call responsible for the error.

---

### My reducer or initializer function runs twice {/*my-reducer-or-initializer-function-runs-twice*/}

In [Strict Mode](/reference/react/StrictMode), React will call your reducer and initializer functions twice. This shouldn't break your code.

This **development-only** behavior helps you [keep components pure.](/learn/keeping-components-pure) React uses the result of one of the calls, and ignores the result of the other call. As long as your component, initializer, and reducer functions are pure, this shouldn't affect your logic. However, if they are accidentally impure, this helps you notice the mistakes.

For example, this impure reducer function mutates an array in state:

```js {4-6}
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'added_todo': {
      // ðŸš© Mistake: mutating state
      state.todos.push({ id: nextId++, text: action.text });
      return state;
    }
    // ...
  }
}
```

Because React calls your reducer function twice, you'll see the todo was added twice, so you'll know that there is a mistake. In this example, you can fix the mistake by [replacing the array instead of mutating it](/learn/updating-arrays-in-state#adding-to-an-array):

```js {4-11}
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'added_todo': {
      // âœ… Correct: replacing with new state
      return {
        ...state,
        todos: [
          ...state.todos,
          { id: nextId++, text: action.text }
        ]
      };
    }
    // ...
  }
}
```

Now that this reducer function is pure, calling it an extra time doesn't make a difference in behavior. This is why React calling it twice helps you find mistakes. **Only component, initializer, and reducer functions need to be pure.** Event handlers don't need to be pure, so React will never call your event handlers twice.

## Why should I learn `useReducer`? {/*why-should-i-learn-usereducer*/}

`useReducer` is a powerful React Hook that allows you to manage state in your components using a reducer function. It provides a way to handle complex state updates and enables you to separate the logic for updating state from the component itself. By learning `useReducer`, you can write more maintainable and scalable code.

## What is `useReducer`? {/*what-is-usereducer*/}

`useReducer` is a React Hook that allows you to manage state in your components using a reducer function. It is an alternative to the `useState` Hook and provides a way to handle complex state updates. With `useReducer`, you can separate the logic for updating state into a separate function called a reducer.

## ELI5 with a kitchen analogy {/*eli5-with-a-kitchen-analogy*/}

Imagine you are cooking in a kitchen. You have a recipe that tells you what ingredients to use and what steps to follow. In this analogy, the recipe is your reducer function, and the ingredients are your state. When you want to update the state, you follow the steps in the recipe to calculate the new state.

## Breakdown of topics {/*breakdown-of-topics*/}

1. `useReducer` function signature and parameters
2. The `dispatch` function and how to use it to update state
3. Common caveats and best practices
4. Examples of how to use `useReducer` in different scenarios
5. Troubleshooting common issues
6. Comparison with other state management options in React

## How to use `useReducer` {/*how-to-use-usereducer*/}

To use `useReducer`, you need to provide a reducer function, an initial state, and an optional initializer function. The reducer function takes the current state and an action as arguments and returns the new state. The initial state is the starting point for your state, and the initializer function is used to calculate the initial state.

Here is an example of how to use `useReducer`:

```javascript
import { useReducer } from 'react';

function reducer(state, action) {
  // ... logic to update state based on action
}

function MyComponent() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
  // ... use state and dispatch in your component
}
```

In this example, `reducer` is the function that specifies how the state gets updated. `initialState` is the initial value of the state. The `useReducer` Hook returns an array with two elements: the current state and the `dispatch` function. You can use the state and dispatch function in your component to read and update the state.

## How to determine when and where to use `useReducer` {/*how-to-determine-when-and-where-to-use-usereducer*/}

`useReducer` is useful when you have complex state updates that cannot be easily handled with `useState`. It is especially useful when you have multiple related state values that need to be updated together. `useReducer` allows you to encapsulate the logic for updating state in a separate function, making your code more modular and easier to reason about.

Here are some scenarios where `useReducer` can be beneficial:

- Managing form state with validation and error handling
- Implementing undo/redo functionality
- Handling complex state transitions in a game or animation
- Managing state for a multi-step wizard or form
- Implementing a state machine

When deciding whether to use `useReducer`, consider the complexity of your state updates and the level of abstraction you want to achieve. If your state updates are simple and straightforward, `useState` may be sufficient. However, if your state updates involve multiple values and complex logic, `useReducer` can provide a more elegant solution.

## Best practices {/*best-practices*/}

When using `useReducer`, it's important to follow some best practices to ensure your code is clean and maintainable:

1. Keep your reducer function pure: The reducer function should not have side effects and should always return a new state object. Avoid mutating the existing state object directly.

2. Separate concerns: If your state updates involve multiple values, consider splitting them into separate actions and cases in your reducer function. This helps keep your code organized and makes it easier to understand and maintain.

3. Use the initializer function when necessary: If your initial state requires complex calculations or depends on external factors, use the initializer function to calculate the initial state. This can help improve performance by avoiding unnecessary calculations on subsequent renders.

4. Use the `dispatch` function sparingly: Only use the `dispatch` function when you need to update the state. Avoid calling it unnecessarily, as it can trigger unnecessary re-renders.

5. Consider using Immer for immutable updates: If you find yourself writing a lot of code to create new state objects, consider using a library like Immer to simplify the process. Immer allows you to write code as if you were mutating objects, but under the hood, it performs immutable updates.

## Trade-offs {/*trade-offs*/}

While `useReducer` provides a powerful way to manage state in React, it also has some trade-offs to consider:

1. Increased complexity: `useReducer` introduces an additional layer of abstraction and can make your code more complex, especially for simple state updates. It may not be necessary to use `useReducer` for every state management scenario.

2. Learning curve: If you are new to React or state management concepts, `useReducer` may have a steeper learning curve compared to `useState`. It requires understanding the concept of reducers and how to structure your state updates.

3. Performance considerations: `useReducer` can be less performant than `useState` for simple state updates, as it involves additional function calls and object copying. However, the performance impact is usually negligible unless you have a large number of state updates.

4. Debugging and tooling: Debugging can be more challenging with `useReducer` compared to `useState`, as the state updates are handled by a separate function. Additionally, some React DevTools features may not work as expected with `useReducer`.

## Interview questions and answers {/*interview-questions-and-answers*/}

Q: What is the difference between `useState` and `useReducer`?
A: `useState` is a simpler Hook for managing state in React, while `useReducer` is more suitable for complex state updates and managing multiple related state values.

Q: When should you use `useReducer` instead of `useState`?
A: `useReducer` is useful when you have complex state updates that cannot be easily handled with `useState`. It is especially useful when you have multiple related state values that need to be updated together.

Q: What is a reducer function?
A: A reducer function is a pure function that takes the current state and an action as arguments and returns the new state. It specifies how the state gets updated based on the action.

Q: What are the benefits of using `useReducer`?
A: `useReducer` allows you to separate the logic for updating state into a separate function, making your code more modular and easier to reason about. It also provides a way to handle complex state updates and manage multiple related state values.

Q: What are some best practices when using `useReducer`?
A: Some best practices include keeping your reducer function pure, separating concerns by using separate actions and cases, using the initializer function when necessary, using the `dispatch` function sparingly, and considering using Immer for immutable updates.
